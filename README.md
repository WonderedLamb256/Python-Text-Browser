# Python-Text-Browser
The most simple type of browser: a terminal browser.
Python Text Browser is an active development. The very first build will be kept, mostly for its accomplishment of being a web browser (albeit broken and showing bits of HTML/CSS/Javascript) in less then one kilobyte and even more remarkably, in less then one drive sector. This excludes needing python and the module urllib to run it. This is based off a web based clock in the Python Tutorial (Chapter 10.7: Web Access). This software is open source as described by the GNU General Public Lisence.
